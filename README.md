Important:
-------------
This is currently working only with the dev version of Vault. It is my first month with HashiCorp and I am using that as a workbench.

What is what:
-------------
vault-totp: Main script that generates the barcode
catpng: Main script that transforms the text to image (.png)

Prerequisites:
-------------
Will need to write some login to check the vault status and that we can communicate with it correctly.

Requirements:
-------------
It works on my computer :D
e.g. works on MacOS. Need to test if natively, or I added some of the tools without realizing.

Usage:
-------------
vault-totp <...> <...>
